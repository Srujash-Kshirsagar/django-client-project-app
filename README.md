# Django Client and Project Management API

## Overview
This project is a **Django-based RESTful API** designed for managing clients and projects within an organization. It allows users to register clients, manage projects, and assign users to those projects, providing a comprehensive solution for project management.

## Key Features
- **Client Management**: Register, update, and delete clients.
- **Project Management**: Create projects for clients and assign users to those projects.
- **User Assignment**: Multiple users can be assigned to a single project, while each project is exclusive to one client.
- **API Endpoints**: Fully functional REST API for easy integration and usage.

## Technologies Used
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework**: For building RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for data storage.
- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
